			<p class="intro">The Trump Administration’s mass deportation agenda is pushing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests to an all time high—<a href="https://stateline.org/2025/12/12/an-ever-larger-share-of-ices-arrested-immigrants-have-no-criminal-record/">30,000 people are being arrested</a> each month, on average. In order to detain and deport those arrested, the federal government relies on a network of jails and detention centers across the country. Without this vast network, mass deportation would not be possible.

				This map captures which states provided the most detention capacity to mass deportation in 2025, based on the number of people detained on average each day and the number of facilities in each state.

	"States governments are political actors in mass deportation. Two states with radically different population sizes might detain a similar number of people, if one is more committed to facilitating deportations than the other," said Stella Park, an immigration attorney at Legal Services NYC. Take Louisiana and California for example. Louisiana has a population size of about 4.6 million, and detained nearly 8,000 people daily in 2025. California is home to more than 39 million people, and yet detained around 3400 people each day—far less than half the amount Louisiana did.
